## Coded By: Peter Janasz

## Description
Created a Jquery document.ready function to prevent the code from running until the browser has finished rendering all elements. Used Jquery to add current date and time. Created an onclick event for the saved buttons so that user inputs are saved in the localStorage. Also created a timeTracker to set appropriate past, present, future class attributes to timeBlocks. Lastly, created a Jquery function to get local storage and display inputs in the appropriate time-block and store the values even after page refresh.
